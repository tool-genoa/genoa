#  GENOA v3.0: the GENerator of Optimized Atmospheric chemical mechanisms
#  Configuration file for GENOA v3.0

#  Purpose:
#    1. Run box model simulations using specified mechanism (U6T-1).
#    2. Compare simulation results with reference results (simulated using U6O
#         and saved in ./test_cases/input/res) for error analysis.
