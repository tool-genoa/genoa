# ================================================================================
#  GENOA v3.0: the GENerator of Optimized Atmospheric chemical mechanisms
#  Configuration file for GENOA v3.0
#
#  Purpose:
#    Run simulation-based reduction (training) with specified options.
#
#    This is a quick test case for training with the following settings:
#      1. Starting-point mechanism: U6T-0 (a previously reduced mechanism).
#      2. Reference mechanism: U6O (the full mechanism).
#
#  For detailed option descriptions, see the reference configuration file:
#    ./test_cases/config/config_reference.ini
